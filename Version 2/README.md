## Introduction

CommunityWatch is an open-source web application built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to address the need for a centralized platform where community members can report and manage local issues. The application was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between residents and local authorities, providing a transparent and interactive way to document and resolve community concerns.

At its heart, CommunityWatch features an interactive map powered by Leaflet.js, allowing users to visualize issues geographically. Whether it’s a broken streetlight, graffiti on a public wall, or an overflowing trash bin, users can report these problems with detailed information, including photos and precise locations. The platform encourages community engagement through upvotes, comments, and a reputation system, while moderators ensure that reported issues are tracked and resolved efficiently.

The application integrates modern technologies such as AI for duplicate detection and semantic search, SQLAlchemy for robust data management, and Bootstrap for a responsive design. It’s designed to be scalable, secure, and extensible, making it an ideal project for developers looking to contribute to a meaningful cause.

This README will take you through every step of getting CommunityWatch up and running, understanding its architecture, and exploring its vast array of features. By the end, you’ll have a thorough understanding of how to use, customize, and contribute to this community-driven platform.

---

## Features

CommunityWatch is packed with features that cater to both end-users and developers. Below, I've categorized them into core functionality, user experience enhancements, advanced features, and security measures for a comprehensive overview.

### Core Functionality

- **Issue Reporting**: Authenticated users can report issues by selecting from predefined categories (e.g., "Pothole," "Waste Dumping," "Flooding"), adding a description, pinpointing the location on the map, and optionally uploading photos. Geolocation data ensures that issues are accurately placed.
- **Interactive Map**: Built with Leaflet.js, the map displays all reported issues as markers, color-coded by status. Clicking a marker reveals detailed information about the issue.
- **Upvoting System**: Users can upvote issues to indicate their significance, helping prioritize community efforts. Each upvote also contributes to the reporter’s reputation points.
- **Commenting**: Authenticated users can leave comments on issues, encouraging discussion and collaboration on potential solutions or updates.
- **Moderation Tools**: Moderators can update issue statuses (e.g., "Reported," "In Progress," "Resolved"), with automatic notifications sent to the reporter and users who upvoted the issue.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **User Profiles**: Every user has a dedicated profile page displaying their username, reputation points, and a list of issues they’ve reported. This fosters transparency and recognizes active contributors.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: A public dashboard provides real-time insights into community issues, including status breakdowns (e.g., percentage of resolved issues), top-voted issues, and a heatmap highlighting areas with unresolved problems.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive instant updates when the status of an issue they’ve reported or upvoted changes, keeping them engaged and informed.
- **Reputation System**: Users earn points for reporting issues, receiving upvotes, and having issues resolved, gamifying participation and rewarding dedication.

### Advanced Features

- **Geo-Semantic Search**: A powerful search feature allows users to find issues using keywords (e.g., "pothole near park") and location filters. AI embeddings ensure that results are semantically relevant, even if exact matches aren’t found.
- **AI-Powered Duplicate Detection**: When a new issue is reported, the system analyzes its location and description against existing issues to identify potential duplicates, streamlining moderation efforts.
- **Weekly Reports**: An AI-generated summary report is available, providing statistics, trends, and insights into recent community issues for users and moderators.

### Security Measures

- **CSRF Protection**: Built into all forms and AJAX requests using Flask-WTF, ensuring that submissions are legitimate and secure.
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are cleaned with the `bleach` library to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, keeping the platform safe.
- **Rate Limiting**: Sensitive endpoints like issue reporting and upvoting are rate-limited (e.g., 10 reports per minute, 20 upvotes per minute) to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Secure File Uploads**: Uploaded photos are stored with secure filenames using `werkzeug`, and access is restricted to authorized users.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CommunityWatch, ensure your system meets the following requirements.

### Software Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or Higher**: The application is built with Python and relies on modern language features.
- **PostgreSQL 12+**: A relational database is used to store users, issues, and related data. Ensure the `psql` command-line tool is available.
- **Node.js (Optional)**: Required only if you plan to manage frontend dependencies locally instead of using CDNs (e.g., for Leaflet.js or Bootstrap).
- **Redis (Optional)**: Used for caching analytics data to improve performance, though the application functions without it.
- **Git**: Necessary for cloning the repository and managing version control.
- **pip**: Python’s package manager, typically bundled with Python, for installing dependencies.

### Hardware Recommendations

While CommunityWatch can run on modest hardware, the following specs are recommended for a smooth experience:

- **CPU**: Dual-core processor (e.g., Intel i3 or equivalent).
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended for development and testing.
- **Storage**: At least 5 GB of free space for the application, database, and uploaded files.
- **Internet**: A stable connection for downloading dependencies and accessing external APIs (e.g., Nominatim for geocoding).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these detailed steps to get CommunityWatch running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by downloading the source code from the project’s GitHub repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexBiobelemo/Project-Andrew-CommunityWatch-/tree/main/Version%202
cd communitywatch
```

This creates a local copy of the project in a directory named `communitywatch`.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment isolates the project’s dependencies from your system-wide Python installation.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:
- **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Your terminal prompt should now indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(.venv)`).

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`.

```bash
pip install flask flask-wtf flask-login flask-limiter flask-caching sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary numpy bleach werkzeug
```

This command fetches and installs all necessary packages in your virtual environment.

### Step 4: Configure the Database

CommunityWatch uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage. Set it up as follows:

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Download and install it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/) if not already present.
2. **Create a Database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   CREATE DATABASE communitywatch;
   \q
   ```
3. **Update Configuration**: Edit `app/config.py` with your database details:
   ```python
   class Config:
       SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/communitywatch'
       SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
       SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-here'
       UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/communitywatch/static/uploads'
   ```

Ensure the `username` and `password` match your PostgreSQL credentials.

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables

Set up environment variables to configure Flask and the application.

- **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  export FLASK_APP=app
  export FLASK_ENV=development
  export SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
  export UPLOAD_FOLDER='/path/to/communitywatch/static/uploads'
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set FLASK_APP=app
  set FLASK_ENV=development
  set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
  set UPLOAD_FOLDER=\path\to\communitywatch\static\uploads
  ```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/path/to/communitywatch/static/uploads
```

Ensure the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` directory exists and is writable:
```bash
mkdir -p static/uploads
chmod -R 755 static/uploads  # Linux/Mac only
```

### Step 6: Initialize the Database

Set up the database schema using Flask-Migrate.

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

These commands create migration scripts and apply them to your database, setting up tables for users, issues, and more.

### Step 7: Run the Application

Launch the Flask development server.

```bash
flask run
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see CommunityWatch in action. The homepage will display the interactive map and issue reporting interface.

The following are useful scripts to run inside the Flask shell (flask shell) for administrative tasks.
Make a User a Moderator
This script finds a user by their username and sets their is_moderator flag to True.
# First, manually import what you need
from app.models import User
from app import db

# Find the user
user = User.query.filter_by(username='THE_USERNAME_HERE').first()

# If the user is found, update and save the change
if user:
    user.is_moderator = True
    db.session.commit()
    print(f"Success! User '{user.username}' is now a moderator.")
else:
    print("User not found.")

Generate Search Embeddings for All Existing Issues
If you add issues to the database manually or need to regenerate search data, this script will create embeddings for all issues that are missing them.
# First, manually import what you need
import sqlalchemy as sa
from app.models import Issue
from app import db

# Find all issues without an embedding
issues_to_update = db.session.scalars(sa.select(Issue).where(Issue.embedding == None)).all()

# Loop through them and generate the embedding
for issue in issues_to_update:
    print(f"Generating embedding for: '{issue.category}'")
    issue.generate_and_set_embedding()

# Commit all the changes to the database
db.session.commit()

print(f"Updated {len(issues_to_update)} issues with search data!")
